// ============================================================
//  VUKEYER — FlexRadio (SmartSDR) backend
//
//  Discovery: the radio broadcasts an ASCII key=value payload.
//  Firmware after v1.1.3 wraps it in a VITA-49 packet on UDP
//  4991; older firmware uses a proprietary format on UDP 4992.
//  Both carry the same "key=value" text, so we listen on both
//  ports and scan the datagram for the fields we need rather
//  than parsing two different headers.
//
//  Command API: TCP 4992, line oriented. We send
//  "C<seq>|<command>"; the radio answers "R<seq>|<hex>|<msg>"
//  and pushes "S<handle>|..." status lines we subscribe to.
//
//  Keying uses "cwx send <text>" — a literal space does not
//  survive the command parser, so spaces go as ASCII 0x7F and
//  the radio translates them back.
//
//  Deliberately NOT implemented: real-time paddle keying over
//  the network. Element timing sent packet-by-packet inherits
//  WiFi jitter; paddles stay on the local key output.
