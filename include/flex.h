// ============================================================
//  VUKEYER — FlexRadio (SmartSDR) backend
//
//  Finds a 6000/8000-series radio on the LAN via its discovery
//  broadcast, opens the SmartSDR command API on TCP 4992, and
//  keys CW with "cwx send" — the radio generates the element
//  timing, so network jitter never reaches the air.
